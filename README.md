**ðŸŽ‰ The official built-in `pnpm dedupe` command is added since `pnpm` [v7.26.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v7.26.0), so this project is retired. ðŸŽ‰**

# pnpm-deduplicate

Remove duplicate dependencies from `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

This project is simple and not have many features. I see it as a temporary solution until we have official built-in `pnpm deduple` command. Pull requests are welcome!

**Support this project by giving it a :star: on GitHub.**

## Install

```
pnpm install -g pnpm-deduplicate
```

## Usage

### Remove duplicates

Go to your project's root directory and run the following command to remove duplicate dependencies:

```
pnpm-deduplicate
```

### List duplicates

If you only want to list duplicates instead of update `pnpm-lock.yaml`, run:

```
pnpm-deduplicate --list
```

You will get a list of duplicates like this:

```
Package "@babel/core" wants ^7.17.10 and could get 7.18.2, but got 7.18.0
Package "@babel/core" wants ^7.15.5 and could get 7.18.2, but got 7.18.0
Package "@babel/core" wants ^7.7.5 and could get 7.18.2, but got 7.18.0
Package "@babel/generator" wants ^7.7.2 and could get 7.18.2, but got 7.18.0
Package "@babel/generator" wants ^7.18.0 and could get 7.18.2, but got 7.18.0
```

This command will return a non-zero exit code if there are duplicates. You can
use it in CI to check if there are duplicates.

## Solutions for other package managers

For Yarn v1, you can use [`yarn-deduplicate`](https://github.com/atlassian/yarn-deduplicate/).

For Yarn v2 or greater version, you can use the built-in [`yarn dedupe`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dedupe) command.

For NPM, you can use the built-in [`npm dedupe`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dedupe) command.

For PNPM, use this tool!

Also, removing `node_modules` folder as well as the lock file (i.e. `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) is another option. This will update all your dependencies to the latest version that matches the version range in your `package.json`, which could break your project.
